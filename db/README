AnoNet Resource Database

as => list of ASNs with owners
dom => list of domains with owners and nameservers
ip => list of direct IP assignments with owners and nameservers
usr => list of users with useful information

The domains are organized by TLD, making it easy to split TLDs off onto
separate TLD servers, if that ever proves to be useful.

The IP claims are classful, the rationale being that reverse DNS is
classful anyway, and so trying to split delegations and rDNS on different
boundries is just an easy way of adding nnnecessary complexity.  If you
want less than a class C, you should just take a full class C and share
it with your friends.  If you want a /23, just take 2 adjacent /24s.
(Remember, your rDNS for the two blocks will have to be separate anyway.)

If anybody wants IPv6, just add an ip6 directory (again, with
subdirectories split according to rDNS rules).

The user directory is intended to facilitate contact between users.
Its original purpose was to maintain git URLs directly in the database
(makes automated git peering dead simple), but it's useful for far more.
Feel free to add arbitrary fields for users, but it may be wise to use an
"x-" prefix if you're not sure about the best name for some field.
