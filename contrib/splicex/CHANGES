CHANGES:

	d3v11 - Sat Oct 22 2011:

		SpliceX is the new replacement for Splice3.
		it includes some new options and should be
		compatible with most versions of Python.

		see README, splicex --help, splicex --rtfm

	d3v11 - Sun Oct 23 2011:

		Added some colour enhancements to SpliceX
		:-). This is a useless update but i thought
		it was fun.

		Also, I trimmed down much unnecessary
		code.

		'deshadow' bug fixed in splicex.py src

	d3v11 - Fri Oct 28 2011:

		SpliceX now compiles to machine language
		via Cython. see README for dependencies
		and installation details.
		
		SpliceX compiler flags patched. recent
		update did not distinguish:

			/usr/include/<python version>

				-FROM-

			/usr/local/include/<python version>

		Thus, if you have debian python-dev or 
		source python-dev the ./configure script
		should choose the appropriate option.
		if the configure still failed to locate
		the python development files (headers)
		please let me know and I will correct.

		SpliceX can now optionally do a pure
		python install. This cuts down on
		dependencies and is useful if you just
		want to test, try, and/or debug.

		SpliceX now detects invalid arguments
		and prints with error message.

	d3v11 - Sat Oct 29 2011:
		
		Old timing bug is now fixed. --time now
		how a consistant tracking of how many
		passwords and how much time has elapsed
		among each brute force algorithm. This
		new patch also simplified the code and
		makes the functions faster. Much code
		has been trimmed from splicex without
		removing any options or functionality.

		--no-char bug fixed
