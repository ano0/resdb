(UN)INSTALL:

	You may optionally install splicex with cython. Doing so takes
	longer to install because of compile times but splicex will
	also be 20% to 35% faster, depending on your system. I recommend
	this option if you intend on putting splicex to long-term use.
	If your goal is simply to test, try, and/or debug splicex then
	using the pythonic install will be more practical.

	NOTES:

		If you installed Python from source you can ignore
		the python-dev dependency below. However, your source
		install of Python must have the development files. IE:

		tar xvf Python-*.tgz
		cd Python-*
		./configure --with-pydebug
		make install

		This generates Python.h and structmember.h, which are
		need for gcc to compile splicex.

	DEPENDS ON:

		python (>=2.6), python-dev(>=2.6), cython (>=0.12.1), 
		gcc (>=4.4.3), bash (>=4.1.5), man (>=2.5.7)

		SOURCE:

			./configure <python[version]>
			make compile
			make install

		DEBIAN/UBUNTU:

			./configure <python[version]>
			make compile
			make install-deb

		UNINSTALL:
	
			SOURCE:
		 		make uninstall

			DEBIAN/UBUNTU:
		 		apt-get remove splicex

PYTHONIC (UN)INSTALL:

	You make optionally install splicex as pure python.
	Install times are quick but splicex will be 20% to 35%
	slower than compiling an executable binary with the
	cython + gcc option above. I recommend using this option
	if you simply want to test, try, and/or debug splicex.

	DEPENDS ON:

		python (>=2.6), bash (>=4.1.5), man (>=2.5.7)

		SOURCE:

			./configure <python[version]> --no-compile
			make install

		DEBIAN/UBUNTU:

			./configure <python[version]> --no-compile
			make install-deb

		UNINSTALL:
	
			SOURCE:
		 		make uninstall

			DEBIAN/UBUNTU:
		 		apt-get remove splicex

TOOLS:

	SpliceX includes brute forcing tools. Each tool will
	include a README file in its respected folder(s):

	ls tools/*

UPDATE:

	d3v11's AnoNet(2) update for splicex:
 
	make update

HELP AND USAGE:

	To obtain additional information on how to use splicex
	enter either of the following commands after installation:

	splicex --help
	splicex --rtfm
