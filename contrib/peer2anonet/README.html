<b>DESCRIPTION:</b>

    peer2anonet is an autoconfiguration utility for
    setting up core services on AnoNet2. Enjoy :-).

<b>DEPENDS ON:</b>

    quicktun, bird, bash for now. it also installs
    some cool shit that you'll use later.

<b>AUTHOR:</b>

    d3v11 from <a href="http://www.d3v11.ano/">www.d3v11.ano</a>, somtimes, maybe, dunno.

<b>REPORT BULLSHIT TO:</b>
        
    /relayhell/d3v11

    d3v11@d3v11.ano

<b>USAGE:</b>

    ./contrib/peer2anonet/peer2anonet --help
    ./contrib/peer2anonet/peer2anonet --rtfm

<b>TORIFY:</b>

    --install-* flags should be compatible with Tor:

    export http_proxy='http://127.0.0.1:8118/'
    ./contrib/peer2anonet/peer2anonet --install-*

    You can use torify or usewithtor on most options
    but setting http_proxy is more reliable.

    torify ./contrib/peer2anonet/peer2anonet --install-*

    usewithtor ./contrib/peer2anonet/peer2anonet --install-*

<b>CONFIGURE:</b>

    I highly recommend that before you use peer2anonet
    you ./configure resdb with tinydns support.

    ./contrib/peer2anonet/peer2anonet --configure

    <b>EXAMPLES:</b>

        Enter your AnoNet subnet: 1.1.5.0
        Enter your AnoNet router: 1.1.5.1
        Enter your peering ip: 1.1.5.2
        Enter your AnoNet asn: 1150

<b>CONFIGURE PEER:</b>

    ./contrib/peer2anonet/peer2anonet --configure-peer

    <b>KEY PAIRS:</b>

        before running peer2anonet to configure peers
        you can use quicktun to generate keypairs:

        quicktun.keypair < /dev/random

    <b>EXAMPLES:</b>

        Enter your peer's name: d3v11
        Enter your peer's remote ip: 11.11.55.1
        Enter your peer's peering ip: 1.1.5.2
        Enter your peer's remote port: 21150
        Enter your local port: 61150
        Enter your peer's asn: 1150
        Enter your peer's public key: * see KEY PAIRS above *
        Enter your private key: * see KEY PAIRS above *

    <b>/SERVICE/$PEER/RUN CHANGES:</b>

        peer2anonet exports the /service/$PEER/run file to
        /etc/peer2anonet/peers/$PEER/run. If you need to
        create customizations for peerings then make 
        adjustments to that file.

    <b>CONFIGURATION FILES:</b>

        If /etc/peer2anonet/bird.conf exists, then
        peer2anonet will not create a new bird. Instead
        it will use this bird.conf and append new protocols
        to it. 

        /etc/peer2anonet/peers/$PEER/* contains:
                
        asn  local_port  peering_ip  pubkey
        remote_ip  remote_port  run  seckey

        In the event you want to reconfigure a peer's tunnel
        you can alter the run file and do `--update', rm run
        and modify the above files then use `--update',  or
        reconfigure the peering tunnel altogether with
        --configure-peer and choose that peer's name. If you
        think this is absurd then you're probably right! I 
        plan on doing something with these files later.

<b>CONFIGURE DNS:</b>

    If you did not ./configure resdb with tinydns support
    then you need to do that before using this function.

    also before using you will need to have installed
    daemontools, djbdns, and ucspi-tcp. peer2anonet
    can do this for you with --install-* options.

    ./contrib/peer2anonet/peer2anonet --configure-dns

<b>UPDATE DNS:</b>

    After a successful `--configure-dns', you can now
    enjoy to use `--update-dns' to bring your AnoNet
    domains up to speed.

<b>SETUP QMAIL:</b>

    <b>WARN:</b>

        You should patch or firewall off qmail from
        reaching IcannNet so someone cannot harvest
        your IP with the mailerdaemon response.

    If you did not ./configure resdb with tinydns support
    then you need to do that before using this function.

    also before using you will need to have installed
    daemontools, djbdns, and ucspi-tcp. peer2anonet
    can do this for you with --install-* options.

    setup-qmail will download and install qmail if it
    isn't already installed and configure your
    mx domain as a.mx.$nick.ano with the ip of your
    resdb git-daemon ip.

    ./contrib/peer2anonet/peer2anonet --setup-qmail

<b>COMPLAIN:</b>

    If this README doesn't tell you what you need to know
    you can head over to www.d3v11.ano/peering. If that
    doesn't get you what you want then either complain to
    me or shoot both of us in the face.
