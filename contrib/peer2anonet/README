INSTALL AND UNINSTALL:
    ******************************************************************
    * PEER2ANONET CAN AND WILL OVERWRITE /service AND /services, TO  *
    * INCLUDE FILES WITHIN THOSE DIRECTORIES. PLEASE CREATE BACKUPS  *
    * BEFORE INSTALLING AND USING PEER2ANONET AT ANY TIME!           *

      make uninstall

      To compile/install a .deb package, as root do:

USAGE:
      You may execute peer2anonet and answer configuration questions
      via interface or pipe a file containing the new peering
      session's specifications to the executable. peer2anonet has
      some security checks but it is highly recommended you check
      a autoconfig file manually before using to prevent malicious
      attacks. An autoconfig file should be in the following format:
      Plain text file, one block of data per line, no spaces, and
      without including the following '<-- comments'.

================== Not Actual Line on File ============================
anon          <--your peer's alias
11.22.33.44   <--your peer's remote ip
1.2.3.4       <--your peer's anonet ip
4321          <--your peer's client port
1234          <--your peer's asn
3c6e0b8a9c15224a8228b9a98ca1531d <--your peer's public key
================== Not Actual Line on File ============================

     At your discretion, you may exclude the public key from the
     bottom of an autoconfig file and post installation of your new
     peer service, peer2anonet will prompt foor it.
