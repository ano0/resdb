USAGE:

    ./contrib/peer2anonet/peer2anonet --configure             generate a new local configuration and exit

    ./contrib/peer2anonet/peer2anonet --update                regenerate peer configurations

    ./contrib/peer2anonet/peer2anonet --configure-peer        generate a new peer configuration and update

    ./contrib/peer2anonet/peer2anonet --rm-peer               remove a peer configuration and update

    ./contrib/peer2anonet/peer2anonet --install-daemontools   installs daemontools

    ./contrib/peer2anonet/peer2anonet --install-ucspi-tcp     installs ucspi-tcp

    ./contrib/peer2anonet/peer2anonet --install-djbdns        installs djbdns

    ./contrib/peer2anonet/peer2anonet --configure-dns         configures dnscache and tinydns zones

RTFM:

    CONFIGURE:

        I highly recommend that before you use peer2anonet
        you ./configure resdb with tinydns support.

        ./contrib/peer2anonet/peer2anonet --configure

        EXAMPLES:

            Enter your AnoNet subnet: 1.2.3.0
            Enter your AnoNet router: 1.2.3.1
            Enter your peering ip: 1.2.3.4
            Enter your AnoNet asn: 1234

    CONFIGURE PEER:

        ./contrib/peer2anonet/peer2anonet --configure-peer

            KEY PAIRS:

                before running peer2anonet to configure peers you can use
                quicktun to generate keypairs:

                    quicktun.keypair</dev/random

            CLIENT PORT:

                peer2anonet uses '20' plus the first four digits of your peer's asn
                as the `clientport'.

                LOCAL_PORT=20${PEERASN:0:4}

            EXAMPLES:

                Enter your peer's name: d3v11
                Enter your peer's remote ip: 11.11.55.1
                Enter your peer's peering ip: 1.1.5.2
                Enter your peer's remote port: 201150
                Enter your peer's asn: 1150
                Enter your peer's public key: * see KEY PAIRS above *
                Enter your private key: * see KEY PAIRS above *

            RUN CHANGES:

                peer2anonet exports the /service/$PEER/run file to
                /etc/peer2anonet/peers/$PEER/run. If you need to
                create customizations for peerings then make adjustments
                to that file.

    CONFIGURE DNS:

        If you did not ./configure resdb with tinydns support
        then you need to do that before using this function.

        also before using you will need to have installed
        daemontools, djbdns, and ucspi-tcp. peer2anonet
        can do this for you with --install-* options.

        ./contrib/peer2anonet/peer2anonet --configure-dns

    COMPLAIN:

        If this README doesn't tell you what you need to know
        you can head over to www.d3v11.ano/peering. If that
        doesn't get you what you want then either complain to
        me or shoot both of us in the face.
