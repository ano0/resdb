DEPENDS ON:
      quicktun, bird, daemontools(non-deb), bash

INSTALL AND UNINSTALL:
    ******************************************************************
    * PEER2ANONET CAN AND WILL OVERWRITE /service AND /services, TO  *
    * INCLUDE FILES WITHIN THOSE DIRECTORIES. PLEASE CREATE BACKUPS  *
    * BEFORE INSTALLING AND USING PEER2ANONET AT ANY TIME!           *
    ******************************************************************

      To install, `cd' to the extracted peer2anonet folder.
      Issue the following commands as root:

      make install

      To uninstall peer2anonet, as root do:

      make uninstall

      To compile/install a .deb package, as root do:

      make install-deb

USAGE:
      You may execute peer2anonet and answer configuration questions
      via interface or pipe a file containing the new peering
      session's specifications to the executable. peer2anonet has
      some security checks but it is highly recommended you check
      a autoconfig file manually before using to prevent malicious
      attacks. An autoconfig file should be in the following format:
      Plain text file, one block of data per line, no spaces, and
      without including the following '<-- comments'.

================== Not Actual Line on File ============================
anon          <--your peer's alias
11.22.33.44   <--your peer's remote ip
3.5.7.9       <--your peer's anonet ip
3571          <--your peer's client port
3570          <--your peer's asn
3c6e0b8a9c15224a8228b9a98ca1531d <--your peer's public key
================== Not Actual Line on File ============================

     At your discretion, you may exclude the public key from the
     bottom of an autoconfig file and post installation of your new
     peer service, peer2anonet will prompt for it.


CHANGES:
      Sat Jul  9 06:48:58 CDT 2011 - d3v1150m471c
      * quicktun's "EXPORT DEBUG=1" removed on peering script.
      * some variables removed, info now passed directly to files.
      * peering.in removed. info passed directly to peering and
        then given executable status. Corresponding makefile
        was also removed.
      * Public key question corrected.
      * daemontools non-deb specified in README.
      * trimmed off unnecessary tests.
      * bash added to dependencies
      * file tests with mkdir changed to `mkdir -p`... .
      * peering file removed, passes directly to run file now.

      Sun Jul 10 05:47:22 CDT 2011 - d3v1150m471c
      * makefile changed to Makefile
      * parse quicktun.keypair</dev/random directly to seckey variable.
      * removed y/n questions with file tests and automatic
        configuration.
      * README file updated
      * ported for autoconfig file pipes
      * some security checks created

      Sun Jul 10 07:25:42 CDT 2011 - d3v1150m471c
      * security checks, whitespace removed after some data

      Sun Jul 10 08:13:17 CDT 2011 - d3v1150m471c
      * security checks changed to check acceptable data and exits
        showing offending info for violating data detections.
      * security checks more specific

      Sun Jul 10 17:04:36 CDT 2011 - d3v1150m471c
      * security check and key bugs patched.

      Sun Jul 10 18:50:31 CDT 2011 - d3v1150m471c
      * public key prompt altered to avoid complications.

      Sun Jul 10 22:01:12 CDT 2011 - d3v1150m471c
      * key inputs changed. peer2anonet no longer generates
        key pairs so they can be manually created prior to 
        using peer2anonet, for expedience.

      Wed Jul 13 04:17:03 CDT 2011 - d3v1150m471c
      * added env variables that are configured on installation
      * uses env variables for certain settings to uncomplicate the
        peering process. A peer now only needs to send you pertinent
        data pertaining to his/her system in order for you to
        configure a new peering session, or vice versa.
