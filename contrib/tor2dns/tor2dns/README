POST INSTALL:
	You will want to make sure port fowarding is turned on, on
	port 8053 of your router, you may also need to adjust your
	firewall. you can test for success by opening your browser
	with tor enabled and going to the link given @ the end of
	your installation. :-) enjoy.

NOTE:
	On some systems /var/lib/tor/tor2dns will need a special owner
	like "debian-tor". If tor2dns fails for you please troubleshoot
	your logs, port fowarding, etc.
