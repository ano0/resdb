hacking quicktun through socks4a:
  peer one should set REMOTE_FLOAT = 0
  peer two should set REMOTE_FLOAT = 1

  i've never actually tested this. but
  it should "just work" with minimal
  shit. if it's really that bad you
  can complain to /relayhell/d3v11.

depends:
  quicktun.raw, socat, daemontools,
  a lot of fucking patience
