CHANGES:
     Fri Sep  9 2011
     d3v11 added timed iterations to bruteforcing algorithms.
           This allows that a user can pause the attacks for
           "X" seconds after every "N" tries.

     Sat Sep 10 2011
     d3v11 fixed bugs associated with previous iteration
           controls.

           fixed an old bug from splice* projects that gave
           invalid speed output. 

           --debug feature was also added. This allows 
           python traceback which identifies errors on
           line(s) from the non-compiled source code.

           --socen changed to --se-create. code associated
           with this option was also given some minor tweaks
           so that more useful passwords are generated from
           user input.

           unused modules and libraries trimmed from import
           on splice3.py and *deshadow.py .

     d3v11 fixed --stdout

           added --no-char flag to override appending
           characters to passwords.

           added --wep-5 and --wep-13 to generate WEP key
           compatible passwords.

     Sun Sep 18 2011
     d3v11 Changed Makefile to prevent install/uninstall
           bugs.

           Made some changes to the manual pages.

     Sat Sep 24 2011
     d3v11 Changed Makefile and disabled py_compile
           to avoid interpreter errors.

     Sat Oct  1 2011
     d3v11 added setup and setup-deb with Makefile
           to check for dependencies and set the
           correct environment paths.
