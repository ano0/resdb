CHANGES:
	Fri Sep  9 2011
	d3v11 added timed iterations to bruteforcing algorithms.
           This allows that a user can pause the attacks for
           "X" seconds after every "N" tries.

	Sat Sep 10 2011
	d3v11 fixed bugs associated with previous iteration
           controls.

           fixed an old bug from splice* projects that gave
           invalid speed output. 

           --debug feature was also added. This allows 
           python traceback which identifies errors on
           line(s) from the non-compiled source code.

           --socen changed to --se-create. code associated
           with this option was also given some minor tweaks
           so that more useful passwords are generated from
           user input.

           unused modules and libraries trimmed from import
           on splice3.py and *deshadow.py .

	d3v11 fixed --stdout

           added --no-char flag to override appending
           characters to passwords.

           compatible passwords.

           on several instant messenger protocols. 

        Sat Oct  9 2011
        d3v11 updated save/restore features for new
              newest modules. changed --se-create
              to function as a module.
              
              fixed setup-deb bug with dependency
              checks.

        Sun Oct 10 2011
        d3v11 updated --se-create to allow module
              stacking. see --rtfm for details.

              null.
